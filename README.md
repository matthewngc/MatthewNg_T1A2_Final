## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio website is to provide prospective employers with an insight into my proficiency over HTML & CSS concepts to build a functional, responsive and professional website.

## Functionality & Features

The portfolio website takes a minimalistic approach to displaying information on a webpage, with each page following a similar theme and structure. The website is easy to navigate, semantically appropriate and professionally styled.

The portfolio website navigates through four different pages:

- A landing page with a digital business card styled container showing my basic personal information, e.g. name, professional photo, contact information, etc.
- An "About Me" page detailing information on my professional and education background, along with my hobbies and interests
- A projects page describing the various projects I have worked on and will be working on in the future, and
- A blog page linking to six blog articles

## Sitemap

All pages on the sitemap, with the exception of the six blog articles, are linked and accessible through the navigation bar in the header.
